| MCU pins and/or diodes     |    | For the pins and the pads at the back, I used diode legs. More on this later |

> Note: 
> - You can also solder the battery directly where the connector goes. If opting for the connector, you'll need to use longer spacers to accomodate them below the pcb
> - Only an encoder or an oled can be used due to limited space.

> **Warning**
> This guide assumes you are capable of soldering the diodes, hotswap sockets, power button, encoder and mcu sockets yourself. You can find videos/guides about these stuff very easily. I have only shared some of the extra things you need to take care of.

#### Pads at the back

We have to solder 3 diode legs to the 3 pads at the back of the xiao. The pads being *BAT+* and the two *NFC* pads at the corner. The other battery pad is ignored as it is internally connected to *GND* pin.

- **Tin the pads**

- **Solder the diode legs**

> **Warning**
> Use low temperature for this (I used 260 C). Hold the legs with help of a tweezer. Flux will help a lot. Try to make the legs straight which shouldn't be difficult as they are easy to bend. **Do not overheat or use excess force or you may end up lifting the pads**.
I soldered multiple xiao like this. It looks scary at first but it just needs patience.

- **Push the controller carefully in the pcb**

- **Solder these legs to the pcb**

Yes, this will make the controller non-removable. You can use pogo pins instead but I wasn't able to find them locally so I went this route.

### Encoder

Before soldering the encoder, make sure the bottom is non-conductive. Since my encoders had a metallic bottom, I used a kapton tape over the oled header.
